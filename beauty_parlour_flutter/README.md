# Beauty Parlour Landing Page

This folder contains a minimal Flutter web app that serves as a landing page for a beauty parlour. Visitors can submit inquiries which are saved to Firebase Cloud Firestore.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter and the FlutterFire CLI.
2. Configure Firebase for the web project and update `firebase_options.dart` and `web/index.html` with your Firebase settings.
3. Run `flutter pub get` in this directory.
4. Serve the app with `flutter run -d chrome`.

The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
